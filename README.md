Pick A Flick Application

Every weekend, all across the globe, fights break out between friends trying to decide which movie to go see that night. Pick a Flick is here to solve the problem. Users will be able to create a group and vote with other users in the group on movies available in their zipcode. The TMS API will choose 5 movies and once the users submit their votes, the Open Agora API will tally the votes and show the winning movie. Users will then be able to votes on showtimes for their chosen movie. Voila! Problem solved.
